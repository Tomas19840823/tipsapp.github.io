    <h1>Terms of Service for TipsApp</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date, e.g., November 22, 2025]</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>TipsApp ("the App") is a technology platform that facilitates the payment of tips directly from a user ("Tipper") to a service industry worker ("Waiter").</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> We, the service provider, act solely as a facilitator and are not a party to any payment transaction. The contract for the payment of a tip is made directly between the Tipper and the Waiter. We do not hold, process, or have custody of any funds. All payments are initiated by the Tipper and transferred directly from the Tipper's bank account to the Waiter's bank account via a third-party Payment Initiation Service (PIS) provider (e.g., Paysera).</p>
    
    <h2>2. Waiter and User Obligations</h2>
    <p>Waiters must provide accurate and current information, including a valid IBAN for receiving payments. The Waiter is solely responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes on tips received. Tippers agree to use the service for its intended purpose of sending voluntary tips.</p>

    <h2>3. Service Cancellation, and Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>This section outlines the rules for service usage, cancellation, and refunds, as required for online payment processing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature of the Transaction:</strong> A tip sent through the App is a voluntary, direct, and final peer-to-peer payment from the Tipper to the Waiter.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cancellation of Sent Tips:</strong> Once a payment is initiated by the Tipper and confirmed through their bank (via the PIS provider), it is processed by the banking system. Due to the nature of direct bank transfers, a sent tip **cannot be cancelled** through our App.</li>
        <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> As we are only a facilitating platform and do not hold any funds, we do not offer or process refunds. A tip is considered a gift from the Tipper to the Waiter. Any disputes regarding a payment must be resolved directly between the Tipper and the Waiter, or through their respective banks. **Our platform does not provide refunds.**</li>
        <li><strong>Account Cancellation:</strong> Users (both Tippers and Waiters) can stop using the service and delete their account at any time through the App's settings. Deleting an account does not reverse any previously completed transactions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Our liability is limited to the provision of the App's technology. We are not liable for any payment disputes, failures, or issues arising between the Tipper, the Waiter, the PIS provider, or the banks involved.</p>
