        <h1>Terms of Service for TipsApp</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> Date of last update, e.g., November 21, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the TipsApp mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). This service is provided by Tipsy. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>TipsApp is a technology platform that facilitates the payment of tips directly from a user ("Tipper") to a service industry worker ("Waiter").</p>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> We are solely a facilitator and are not a party to any payment transaction. The contract for the payment of a tip is made directly between the Tipper and the Waiter. We do not hold, process, or have custody of any funds at any point. All payments are initiated by the Tipper and transferred directly from the Tipper's bank account to the Waiter's bank account via a third-party Payment Initiation Service (PIS) provider (Opay).</p>

        <h2>3. Waiter Obligations</h2>
        <p>Waiters who register for the service must provide accurate and current information, including their full name and a valid IBAN for receiving payments. The Waiter is solely responsible for the accuracy of this information and for reporting and paying any applicable taxes on tips received through the App.</p>

        <h2>4. Tipper Obligations</h2>
        <p>Tippers agree to use the service for its intended purpose of sending tips. All payments are final and non-refundable unless otherwise required by law.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Because we are not a party to the transaction, we are not liable for any disputes, payment failures, or issues arising between the Tipper and the Waiter. Our liability is limited to the provision of the App technology itself. We are not liable for any issues caused by the PIS provider (Opay) or the banks involved.</p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All content and software associated with the App is the property of Tipsy and is protected by copyright and intellectual property laws.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any user account for violating these Terms or engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities.</p>
