    <h1>Terms of Service for TipsApp</h1>
    
    
    <h2>1. Description of Service & Funds Flow</h2>
    <p>TipsApp ("the App") is a technology platform that facilitates the payment of tips from a user ("Tipper") to a service industry worker ("Pro" or "Recipient").</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Merchant Agent Role:</strong> Tips sent via the App are deposited into the TipsApp account. TipsApp acts as the <strong>Merchant Agent</strong> for the Recipients (Pros). Funds are subsequently distributed and transferred to the Recipients in accordance with these Terms and the Merchant Agent Agreements.
    </div>

    <p>By using the App, the Tipper acknowledges that payment to TipsApp (as the agent) constitutes payment to the Pro. The Pro acknowledges that TipsApp accepts these funds solely for the purpose of remitting them to the Pro.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Fees and Pricing</h2>
    <h3>2.1 For Businesses and Employers</h3>
    <p>TipsApp is a <strong>completely free solution</strong> for businesses and employers. There are <strong>no setup fees</strong>, <strong>no monthly fees</strong>, and <strong>no fixed-term contracts</strong>. You may stop using our services at any time without penalty.</p>

    <h3>2.2 For Pros (Recipients)</h3>
    <p>There is no cost to create a profile or appear on the map. A <strong>transaction fee of 4%</strong> is deducted from each tip received to cover payment processing and platform maintenance costs. The remaining balance is transferred to the Pro's designated bank account.</p>

    <h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>
    <p><strong>3.1</strong> The Payer (Tipper), using the payment initiation service (PIS) provided by the designated Payment Service Provider, confirms the transfer of funds. By performing the action, the Payer also agrees to the Payment Service Provider's rules.</p>
    <p><strong>3.2</strong> By making the payment, the Payer confirms that they have understood and agree with the conditions set out in these rules.</p>

    <h2>4. User Obligations & Security</h2>
    <p>You agree not to attempt to bypass, disable, or otherwise interfere with any security-related features of this Website or the App. You agree to provide accurate and current information, including a valid IBAN for receiving payments.</p>

    <h2>5. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless TipsApp, its partners, and affiliates from any claims, lawsuits, demands for costs, and damages (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees) that we may directly or indirectly incur due to:</p>

        <li>(c) Your violation of any third-party rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The conditions provided in this section regarding indemnification shall remain valid even after the termination or expiration of these Terms or after you stop using this Website.</p>

    <h2>6. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>Users may upload profile photos, workplace details, and comments. The following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Locations:</strong> We reserve the right to edit or remove inaccurate location entries.</li>
        <li><strong>Conduct:</strong> Hate speech, harassment, or defamatory comments are strictly prohibited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Service Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Cancellation of Sent Tips:</strong> Once a payment is initiated by the Tipper and confirmed through the bank, it is processed immediately. A sent tip cannot be cancelled through our App.</li>
        <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> Tips are considered voluntary gratuities. TipsApp does not issue refunds. Any disputes regarding a payment must be resolved directly between the Tipper and the Pro.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Recipients, the institution, and TipsApp are not responsible for the unavailability of the system due to no fault of theirs and for other malfunctions beyond their control (e.g., banking system outages).</p>
