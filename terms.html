    <h1>Terms of Service for TipsApp</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 12, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>TipsApp ("the App") is a technology platform that facilitates the payment of tips directly from a user ("Tipper" or "User") to a service industry worker ("Pro" or "User"). The App allows Users (Pros) to create profiles, list their workplace locations, and receive voluntary tips. It allows Tippers to locate Pros, leave ratings and comments, and initiate payments.</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> We, the service provider, act solely as a facilitator and are not a party to any payment transaction. The contract for the payment of a tip is made directly between the Tipper and the Pro. We do not hold, process, or have custody of any funds. All payments are initiated by the Tipper and transferred directly from the Tipper's bank account to the Pro's bank account via a third-party Payment Initiation Service (PIS) provider (e.g., Paysera).</p>
    
    <h2>2. User Obligations</h2>
    <p><strong>For Pros:</strong> You agree to provide accurate and current information, including a valid IBAN for receiving payments and a truthful representation of your workplace. You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes on tips received.</p>
    <p><strong>For Tippers:</strong> You agree to use the service for its intended purpose of sending voluntary tips and leaving honest feedback.</p>

    <h2>3. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>Since the App allows Users to upload data (profile photos, new location details, and comments), the following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profile Photos:</strong> Pros must upload photos that they have the right to use. Photos must not be offensive, explicit, or violate copyright laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating Locations:</strong> When adding a new workplace location, Users must provide accurate details (Name, Coordinates). We reserve the right to merge, edit, or remove duplicate or inaccurate location entries.</li>
        <li><strong>Ratings & Comments:</strong> Feedback left by Tippers must be based on genuine interactions. Hate speech, harassment, profanity, or defamatory comments are strictly prohibited and may be removed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Service Cancellation and Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>This section outlines the rules for service usage, cancellation, and refunds, as required for online payment processing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature of the Transaction:</strong> A tip sent through the App is a voluntary, direct, and final peer-to-peer payment from the Tipper to the Pro.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cancellation of Sent Tips:</strong> Once a payment is initiated by the Tipper and confirmed through their bank (via the PIS provider), it is processed by the banking system. Due to the nature of direct bank transfers, a sent tip <strong>cannot be cancelled</strong> through our App.</li>
        <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> As we are only a facilitating platform and do not hold any funds, we do not offer or process refunds. A tip is considered a gift from the Tipper to the Pro. Any disputes regarding a payment must be resolved directly between the Tipper and the Pro, or through their respective banks. <strong>Our platform does not provide refunds.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Account Cancellation:</strong> Users (both Tippers and Pros) can stop using the service at any time. Data removal requests can be handled by contacting the service provider.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Our liability is limited to the provision of the App's technology. We are not liable for any payment disputes, failures, or issues arising between the Tipper, the Pro, the PIS provider, or the banks involved. We are not responsible for the accuracy of user-generated content (e.g., incorrect location pins).</p>
